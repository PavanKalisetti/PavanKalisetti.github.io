        <h1>About Our Educational Institute</h1>
        <p> The primary objective of establishing RGUKT was to provide high quality educational opportunities
        for the aimed rural youth of Andhra Pradesh. The initial goal was that at least
        the top 1 % of the rural graduates would be given the opportunity to study at RGUKT.
        The top 1% of rural graduates is around 6,000 to 7,000 per year. Thus, the three campuses would need 
        residential accommodation for about 36,000 students for the six year integrated program.
        At present, most universities in India and in Andhra Pradesh follow the affiliated college structure
        model where the main role of the university is to set the curriculum and conduct examinations to 
        ensure that the students have indeed learned the material prescribed in the curriculum. 
        Most colleges have an entering class of 100-300. Having an entry class of 6,000 students leads to issues of scale. 
        This is unique to RGUKT and is being attempted for the first time in India. In the US, several of the larger 
        universities do have enrolments of 20,000 to 30,000. However not all of them tend to be residential universities.
        Thus RGUKT, as a green field university, represents a unique experiment in the educational arena.
        The assumption is that ICT (Information and Communication Technologies), will permit the scaling of the 
        learning environments by one to two orders of magnitude is currently possible.Another key educational objective of RGUKT 
        is to use advances in learning sciences and explore the use of modern cognitive science tools in education and learning.</p>
